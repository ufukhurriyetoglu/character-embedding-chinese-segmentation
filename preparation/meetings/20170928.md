#### Original Hypotheses

- We can avoid maintaining a dictionary by man power
- We can catch more out-of-vocabulary words
- Chinese in character unit can have meanings
- We can find out valid 2-character words from frequency information

#### Proposed method

1. Train character embeddings
      - Is context-enhanced model still meaningful?
      - Component information, word context, etc.
2. Cluster results
3. Learn word list by counting
4. Build connections between words
5. Observe cluster-to-cluster connections
    - Linguistics knowledge?
    - Not semantically compositional Chinese words?
        - Transliterated words, single-morpheme multi-character word (聯綿詞), entity names, etc.
    - If not exhaustive enough, should we enhance with dictionaries?
6. Apply to Chinese word segmentation
    - Graphical knowledge or statistical knowlege?
  
#### Goals

- Avoid maintaining a dictionary by man power
- Catch more out-of-vocabulary words
- Embedding-based word segmentation
- Linguistic knowledge observation from patterns of distributed character representations

#### Difficulties

- Long studied topic with high-accuracy baselines
- New attempt, feasibility unknown
- Lack of experience

#### Alternative directions
