[What is the model]  
[Fusion methods]

- Hypothesis
  - In logographic languages, character-level semantic or phonetic similarity are often indicated by visual cues, 
  which CNN can capture
  - Character-level models have been proved effective for rare words, so can this model
- Advantage
  - Simple
  - Generalizable to different languages
  - Handle rare characters effectively
  - Effective under low-resource scenarios
- Dataset
  - Requirements
    - Must fully utilize each character in the input
    - Must be enough compositionality & regularity in the language
  - Input
    - Wikipedia article title in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean
  - Output
    - Category the article belongs to
  - Statistics
    - Each language follows 80/20 rule for character rank-frequency distribution (long-tail distribution)
    - Training:validation:testing = 6:2:2
    - Traditional Chinese & simplified Chinese
- Evaluations
